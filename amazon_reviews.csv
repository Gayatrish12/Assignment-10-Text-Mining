0,5,"13106 is the retractable cord and has 400 steam holes. 13101 has 300 steam holes and a non-retractable cord. (This cord has the ability to adjust to fall to the right or left, which is a nice feature). The ceramic coated faceplate is nice, but not as smooth and ""slidey"" (haha) as a stainless steel faceplate. It took a little adjustment, but after a bit it didn't bother me.Other than the size/weight difference to allow for the retractable code and the steam holes, these two irons are very very similar. The 13101 faceplate is slightly shorter and the water opening is slightly smaller, and the on-light is in a different location. Everything else is the same.What i like: 30min auto shut off! As a quilter who alternates between pressing and sewing, the auto shut offs for most irons turn off too soon, so you are always waiting for it to heat up. Not so with a 30 min window- plus it beeps first to let you know so you can tip it to restart the timer. This gives me some piece of mind in the event i forget about the iron.Nice steam and a burst of steam button. It also has a sprayer built in and a nice sized reservoir so you arent constantly filling it.What I dont like:No off button/setting. You can't actually turn this iron off. You can leave it for 30 mins and it will shut off by itself, or you have to unplug it.The light stays on all the time if plugged in, even if the iron is not heated. This means if you want to keep your iron plugged in the light will stay on, even though it isn't hot.I decided to keep the 13101 iron as i do not actually put my iron away (leave it out in the sewing room) and I liked the lighter weight/smaller profile of the 13101 vs. the 13106."
1,V,"This is my first experience with a Chi iron.  I was impressed with its appearance and features. This is a well designed and sturdy iron, but let me elaborate on the 6 Ironclad reasons, I like it:1. Ceramic Soleplate versus Stainless Steel - I have used stainless steel or inox irons in the past but find they have issues with static and found the Chi iron to be a better performer with a nice distribution of steam and/or heat.  You don't have to worry about cooking your clothes with the Chi.2. Solid, comfortable grip - If you find yourself frequently ironing, you will appreciate the lightweight Chi (only 2 1/2 pounds) and how the iron glides with ease as opposed to other past or traditional irons3. Holier than thou - the 300 holes in the Soleplate distribute steam evenly and does a great job on your clothes.4. Precision and Precaution -  The automatic shutoff feature goes beyond my former iron.  If the iron falls over and is resting on its side or resting on its Soleplate, the iron will automatically shut off in 60 seconds.  I think this is important in our current world full of distractions.  The iron also automatically shuts off if not in use for 30 minutes.5. Water Fill Door - The water fill door flips up, and below is a funnel area where water is added.  Not only is this a more attractive design option, it is more manageable from a design perspective to add water, and there was no dribbling and spilling. Note: if you have extremely hard water, it's best to alternate between tap water and distilled water.6. 2 Year Warranty -  Yes, it's limited. However, the product is covered in most cases should there be a manufacturing defect.BUT WAIT... THERE'S MOREThis iron comes with a nice long 12ft cord that doesn't kink or tangle.  There is even a piece of Velcro attached for easy storage.The iron's settings are easy to understand.  There are choices for linen, cotton, wool, silk, synthetic, and min. (minimum setting is on the upper far right and is where the iron should be set for plugging and unplugging).  The dial moves seamlessly and there is a light click into each setting.Above the dial there is an adjustable steam lever.  You can choose levels from no steam to lots of steam.  This unit can really produce a nice puff of steam.I'd recommend keeping the instructions.  Not only do they advise about iron functions, but there are also tips on ironing, and ironing versus pressing, fabric facts, and care and cleaning (iron does have self cleaning function).The word ""Chi"" can mean many things, such as air, breath, and vital energy, and the balance of positive and negative energy. For me, the Chi iron made the mundane and undesirable task of ironing a lot more pleasant and was rightly named.Recommend!"
2,4,"This CHI Professional Steam Iron is a solid performer with many features usually only found on more expensive irons.My other iron is a Rowenta DW5080, which lists for $30 more than the CHI, but they are surprisingly similar in looks as well as features. Both are 1700 watts. Both have large temperature control dials under the handle. Both have steam burst and spray buttons on top of the iron. Both hold 10oz. of water. Both have multiple steam holes. Both have precision tips that allow you to easily iron around buttons, pleats, pockets and other challenging areas. Both have stable, rubberized iron rests that really grip your ironing board pad. Both have an auto-off features, although with differences in the auto-off time.The biggest difference between the two irons is the soleplate. The Rowenta has a stainless steel soleplate and this CHI has a titanium-infused ceramic soleplate. The soleplate is the reason I wanted to try this iron. I iron a lot of cotton and linen shirts and use fabric sizing or spray starch often. It builds up on a stainless steel soleplate and cleaning it off is a a chore - sometimes a major chore. I have heard that ceramic soleplates resist buildup and are much easier to clean.This iron is noticeably lighter than my Rowenta, although at 2.9 oz. dry weight, it isn't what I would call a lightweight iron. Weight is important depending upon what you normally iron and how much arm strength you have. In general, expensive irons are heavier and they have an advantage when ironing heavy cottons, linen and denim because the weight means you need to apply less pressure to get wrinkles out. However, if you generally iron lighter weight clothing and fabrics, the extra weight isn't necessary and can be tiring during long ironing sessions.I do iron a lot of heavy, natural fabrics that are prone to wrinkling but this iron handled them admirably. I did have to use more pressure than with my Rowenta, but not excessively so. It certainly got hot enough for even heavy denim and the steam it produces is abundant - needed to iron out wrinkles in heavy cotton and linen.The soleplate feels rather like the surface of a non-stick pan. It does not glide quite as smoothly over fabric as a mirror polished stainless steel soleplate but OMG, it's so much easier to clean! All you have to do is set the temp to the highest linen setting for 2 minutes and then iron over a damp, 100% cotton cloth like a dishcloth. I even tested it with heavy spray starch and all of the starch residue came off so easily with no iron cleaner required. This is a big plus for me as I starch my husband's shirts.The main downside to ceramic soleplates is that they are more fragile. You need to take care not to iron over zippers or snaps or rivets or other metal items because it can damage the ceramic coating. Also, never scrub it with a metal scouring pad or with an abrasive like Comet cleanser.There are 300 steam holes in the soleplate and it produces nice, even steam while ironing. Filling the water reservoir is as easy as any other iron. Flip open a lid on the top and pour 10 oz. of water into the reservoir. (I measured.) I suggest using a small measuring cup to measure 10 oz. because the red water reservoir is kind of hard to see through to gauge the water level and if you add too much water, you will get drips. Even though the red is stylish looking, I hope CHI will consider a clear reservoir in the future.If you have very hard water, as I do, CHI says to alternate between distilled water and tap water. Otherwise, you can use tap water all the time. There is a lever above the temperature dial that lets you set the amount of steam you want. There is also a self-clean button to keep the steam holes clear of any mineral build-up that might occur. Additionally, there is an anti-drip feature that prevents drips when dry ironing things like silk that will easily water spot.Another thing I LOVE is the 10 ft. cord. It's 2 feet longer than my Rowenta and believe me, it makes a difference.Another nice thing is the auto-off feature. If left face down or tipped on its side, the iron shuts off in 30 seconds. However, if left sitting up, it shuts off in 30 minutes. That's great for people who sew or quilt as it isn't turning off all the time, leaving you to wait for it to heat up again.I sew a great deal, along with ironing clothing, so a good iron is important to me. My thoughts are that if you iron clothing a lot and use sizing or spray starch, this is a fabulous iron because of the ease with which you can clean the soleplate. It also offers superior performance without the weight of many premium irons for people who have minimal arm strength. If you are someone who irons heavy, wrinkle-prone fabrics on a regular basis, a heavier, stainless steel soleplate makes ironing easier and it goes faster because of the weight of the iron.Since I iron clothing and all sorts of fabric on a regular basis, I'm happy to have both irons. Why not have different irons for different ironing needs? Especially since this CHI iron makes ironing my husband's shirts sooooo much easier!UPDATE 4/12/2018: I also have the Manual Controls with Retractable Cord version of this iron, now, too. It is basically the same iron as the base model but with a few extra goodies. First, it has a retractable cord, which I love. It makes it safer for me to allow the iron to cool down because I don't have to worry about cats or kids yanking on the cord. However, the cord is only 8ft long on the retractable version - 2ft shorter than on the standard corded version.The controls are identical on both irons.The soleplate is titanium ceramic coated on both irons but on the retractable cord version, it has 400 steam holes vs 300 steam holes and the soleplate is just a bit longer. The extra holes provide more steam delivery so are good for people who use the steam feature heavily.The retractable cord iron is taller, too, to accommodate the coiled cord inside and it's a little heavier for the same reason.The port where you add water is more elongated and just a bit easier to fill on the retractable cord version, too.There are some other, strictly cosmetic differences but basically, it is the same iron with a deluxe (more steam holes) soleplate and a shorter, retractable cord. I think if you are trying to decide between the two models, it comes down to whether or not you like the retractable cord and whether or not you want the larger number of steam holes."
3,5,"This is a wonderful iron!  I've used it regularly for about 6 months. The weight seems perfect - heavy enough but not too heavy and it's very well balanced. The extra long cord is very convenient and the 30 minute automatic shut off is a great feature - one of the main reasons I chose the Chi. As a quilter, I don't have to worry about the iron constantly shutting off while I am sewing but I also know that if I were ever to forget and leave the iron on, it would turn itself off in 30 minutes. Best iron ever!"
4,5,"Absolutey the best iron I have ever had - and I've had many brands including 3 Rowentas, including the top end one. Amazingly light, more steamholes than any other iron - but I think it is the 1700 watts that really is the key. All my friends wanted to try it and swore they were going home to order one. I never heard of this brand before, but if it holds up well and I get a couple of years out of it working well, I'll be deliriously happy. If you haven't ever used 1700 watts - order this and test for yourself.  (I wear a lot of linen and ironing it with this iron is a totally new experience! And a very pleasant one!  One or two passes and zero wrinkles.  I also sew and the key to a professional look starts with being able to get a good press on the seams - something I have never had before without a lot of effort...zippo effort with this one!"
5,2,"First of all, this iron really is sleek.  Out of the box, it heats nicely and puts off a moderate amount of steam when the steam is turned fully up.  I don't think it's as powerful as the advertising copy above states (my cheap Black & Decker was more powerful), but it's good enough for most purposes.The soleplate is shaped really nicely and is large enough for good sized areas but tapers to get those little bits.  It heats to the tip, which I've found doesn't always happen with other irons.  I had no problems filling the water reservoir right out of the jug of my distilled water.These features earn it two stars.The Bad - Or Why This Iron Doesn't Get Three More Stars.I purchased this iron first in February 2018.  I sew about 30 hours a week as a seamstress, and I use the iron at least 4-5 hours a week.  What I iron is almost entirely 100% cotton.Within a week, it failed to come to full temperature or generate hardly any steam.  Within another week I heard an alarming crackling and popping from inside the iron, and then with the last pop, it suddenly turned off, also triggering my surge protector.  It would not turn back on or heat up after that.  I exchanged it for another one with Amazon.The replacement iron arrived March 2018, and worked very well.  I was pleased with it.  But the soleplate suddenly gunked up (and I still can't figure out why since it was all washed cotton without sizing or starch.)I used Faultless Hot Iron Cleaner on it, after checking both Faultless's and CHI's websites and manuals to be sure it was okay on ceramic.  I used baby washcloth material to lightly rub the Hot Iron Cleaner on, and within seconds the ""ultra-strong and scratch-resistant"" (above ad copy's words) was wearing off, as you can see in the pictures.  It really looks worse already than my previous iron, which is 5 years old and from Walmart, and still works even though I dropped several times early on! (totally my fault!)My mistake was contacting CHI and not Amazon, since I was still within the Amazon return window.  I wanted more information, and Amazon couldn't give it.  I gave CHI my purchase date in the initial email, and told them what happened.  They immediately responded asking for more information, and I responded back as it sounded like they would replace the defective iron.  After a week, I emailed again, because I hadn't gotten a response.  During that week, my return window with Amazon lapsed.  Since then they have responded quickly to my emails again.What you don't know when you purchase this product is that the limited warranty doesn't cover the shipping fees to replace a defective iron.  They were willing to replace my month-old defective iron but only if they could charge my credit card around $12 to ship it to me.  This is spelled out the ""Care and Use"" manual sealed inside the iron box (and also if you happen to be extra smart and download the PDF manual under ""technical specifications"" in the Product Information of this Amazon listing, it's on page 11, which I didn't.)The shipping price isn't outlandish for something of that weight, and customer service even offered me a discounted rate of $8, which was very kind.  But I agreed to pay Amazon's price.  I'm not willing to pay more to get what I paid for - a non-defective iron.  Especially as so far, the odds don't seem to be in my favor with this iron.  I'll use it until it's unusable, and then I'll be going with a different brand.So buyer beware the warranty!If you found this helpful, would you please click the ""yes"" button?"
6,5,"I was in need of a good iron after the cheap one I purchased 12 years ago finally bit the dust.  I wanted to be sure to purchase a good quality iron this time around.  After reading several reviews on different irons, I decided to take a chance on the CHI.  I'm so glad I did!  This iron is amazing.  When I get done ironing my husband's stubborn Columbia shirts it looks like I've taken them to the dry cleaners to have them pressed!  For a girl who once hated ironing, I really don't mind it as much now that I have the CHI.  Plus it comes with a 2 year warranty!  I would def recommend this to anyone looking for a good high quality iron."
7,5,"I am basically a quilter and I also collect and use vintage tablecloths. I have had numerous irons that are ok for a while but in the end just don’t do the job. My main complaint as a quilter was the short time before the iron automatically shut down. You’d get a piece ready to iron and you’d have to wait until it heated up again. Maddening! I actually was looking for an expensive well known iron but everyone was out. I bought this one, a brand totally unknown to me, because it had a 30 min time before it shut down. I’ve used it for a couple weeks and it is hands down the BEST iron I have ever had. I LOVE it! It’s fine without steam but spectacular with it. Unless you need it for stiffness ( like my tablecloths) you won’t need starch to iron out wrinkles. It’s really great."
8,1,This Chi iron is absolutely horrible. The plate got completely ruined after only 1 week of light used and cannot be cleaned. Its now unusable and I would like someone to contact me about this! I have photos as well
9,5,"I purchased this iron almost a year ago to replace a one year Rowenta that fell off my ironing board and broke.  I didn't want to purchase another Rowenta because I wasn't impressed with it. After doing a lot of reviews, I settled for this (CHI Steam Iron with Titaniun Infused Soleplate - Model 13101).  I couldn't be happier with my decision.  The iron is actually the best I've ever owned.  I line dry a lot of cotton blouses, so require good steam to remove the wrinkles.  This does the trick.  I don't have to use both steam and spray nor do I need to iron the same spot over and over to get the wrinkles out.  My hubby and I are not laundry day ironers, so we do one or two items on average 4 times/week. I do not empty the water reservoir and have had no issues after almost a year of use.  Great value - Fantastic iron"
10,5,"Literally just received the iron and instantly loved it. It works really well. The steam is perfect and enough for every day wear type of clothes. I did notice that when I used the sprayer to spray, water leaked all over and figured out that the sprayer is plugged. I’m not sure if it’s a manufacturer defect but I’m gonna have to get it replaced. Other than that the iron works great. Definitely recommend.Update: iron was immediately replaced by amazon and I now have complaints. Everything works well! Thanx Amazon!"
11,5,"I don't know if I am a certified customer, but I DID buy this iron from Amazon long ago.This is one seriously good buy that I have made. My mother thought I was nuts to spend this much on a steam iron, but this one really does what it is supposed to do and does it well. Now that I have it, I am really glad.My previous iron would turn off after a few minutes, leaving me constantly frustrated waiting for it to reheat after a quick trip to the sewing machine. This iron will stay hot. I do not know exactly how long, but after about one half hour or so it does beep to remind you that is still on. If you leave it turned on and facedown, it will beep after a few minutes.This iron really brings the heat, and it brings the steam as well, making short work out of yards of wrinkled cotton duck canvas, yet it has a delicate touch when turned to the ""synthetic"" or ""silk"" settings. This is a relatively heavy iron, so it does the work for you, not leaving you to push it into the fabric trying to get the effect you want.There are several accessories that you'll want to have in addition to the iron. One is a delicate teapot or a small funnel for getting water into the steam tank opening. The steam tank holds a good bit of water, but it will overflow if you put too much in. No harm done; you just have some water to mop up. The tank holds about 300 mL, or a little over a cup. Be ready to refill often if you are using the steam setting.Another item you will want to have is an iron cleaning kit. This is an awesome iron, and it does not get sticky easily, but it is a fact of life that all irons will encounter gunk eventually, particularly if you are working with starch. I use a kit made by Rowenta, and it has held out for years. It has a tube of cleaning compound, a rag for applying it to the iron's sole, and a last rag for polishing the sole of the iron when you are done cleaning. When you get the kit, read the directions for more specific details.The last tool I find handy is a hair mister. You will find one listed as a beauty product. It sprays a very fine mist on the fabric you are working on and you can control the density of the mist by the distance that you hold the tool. There is a sprayer mounted on the iron, but the spray it puts out is  anemic and difficult to place where you need the water. So do yourself a favor and pick up a hairspray out from the beauty department. I have two of them!Please watch your left hand if you are right-handed. I was holding some fabric down with my left hand while I was ironing, and by accident I tipped the iron in the direction of my left hand. The burn I inflicted on my left index finger was something to behold. The day after the burn, it blistered to the point where the blister popped. At that point I kept it under a Band-Aid for a number of days until the burn healed enough to do without a Band-Aid. I almost nailed my thumb a little while later, but I put ice on it right away and I must not have gotten that much steam on it because it only hurt a little bit for a few days. Forgive me if this is too much information, but you really need to know. If you are left-handed, keep an eye on your right hand. While I am on the topic of hands, I might as well mention that this iron is ambidextrous. You may use it equally with either hand.If you are serious about your sewing, get this iron. If you are just starting out and you have the money, get this iron. If you have kids around, maybe get a different iron, one that turns off right away when you leave it. This includes most irons. If you are just starting out and you do not get this iron, eventually you might want to upgrade. I'm just saying."
12,5,"It is frustrating to need the iron and find it cold when quilting.  This one stays hot (and I mean hot, not warm)  for 30 minutes.  To start the timer merely set it on its butt and the timer starts.  The part I really like is that this iron has a beeper that tells you it is about to turn itself off.  I hear the beep, and stop piecing long enough to lay the iron face down and then back on its butt again, which starts another 30 minute cycle.  If I can't get to the iron when the beeper goes off and it gets cold... I merely change the position and it is hot almost immediately."
13,5,"I bought this Chi Iron for my sewing room. I wanted a Rowenta level iron, but have been concerned with the negative reviews on their irons recently. My setup uses a silicone iron rest and a large wool pressing mat on the end of my large work table. When it first arrived I set it up and was impressed with hot fast it heated. This iron is more wattage than I’ve owned previously. I get a small amount of dimming on lights that are plugged into my outlets, but I expected that. I sew with mostly woven fabrics of varying weights, linen and cotton. I filled the water tank. Steamed up a wrinkled linen. Not “insanely crisp” after one pass but not wrinkled. But it was leaking from the handle right below the water tank lid. I emptied the while thing out, refilled carefully. Aaaand leaking again. I messaged Amazon and they had a replacement at my house the next day. I was able to choose my local Whole Foods for the returned package and dropping it there was easy peasy. The counter was at the front of the store, they scanned the barcode in my Amazon App and showed me the confirmation on their end. Three seconds. And I needed bread so that was perfect. The second iron worked just as great with no leaking at all. I’ve been using it a month now and I am still in love with it. Best features: Heats fast fast fast, from cold to whatever temp you pick. Water tank holds a lot of water and is easy to see where the water level is located. Steam is fantastic. Buttons are easy to push and the cap for the water flips up easily. (My last iron had a water cap that was more like a secret door because it was so hard to open without a nail file or something tiny) Oh and it’s easy to see what setting and if the iron is on from far away because of the light at the base of the handle and the large letters on the settings that light up. Oh, AND the cord is so long I can plug it in 5 feet away and still have room to navigate.Cons: Small hole for water. See photos, I use my tiny watering can and it’s perfect!! The nose of the iron isn’t quite as thin as I wanted, but it is still okay.See photos for visuals. 💕"
14,5,"I’m a quilter.  I have my iron on for hours at a time, run a ton of water through the steam and use it daily.  I’m an iron killer!  I’ve tried everything from the high end brands to what I consider disposable ones.I’ve only had this one for a short time, but I’m in love with this iron!!  It presses amazingly well.  The steam is great and it holds a fair amount of water in the tank.  It heats fast, stays in for 30 minutes before auto shut off kicks in.  Now, to test the longevity!  Hoping that the Iron Killer has met her match!"
15,5,"Great iron! I'm besotted with it. Yes, it gurgles a bit, but it doesn't leak like my Rowenta. And I don't have to use that creepy, expensive soleplate cleaner because this one is ceramic! I use ONLY distilled water and recommend that strongly. The trouble and cost is negligible next to the mineral build-up that's inevitable with tap water. This iron heats up very quickly to the correct temperature, and it doesn't turn itself off if you walk over to the sewing machine for three minutes--it stays on for a half hour! This makes a huge difference to someone who sews and must iron at every step. The steam production is good, the soleplate glides quite smoothly over fabric, the iron is heavy enough to do some of the work for you but not too heavy. I love it. Oh, and product support for CHI is good. It takes a while for customer service to reply, but they do and they're thorough."
16,5,"I bought this iron recently after suffering through 5 miserable years with a German-made Rowenta.  It should be noted that I'm not a quilter and I use this iron primarily to iron dress shirts for work.  With that said, this thing heats up quickly and doesn't piss water all over my shirts like the Rowenta used to.  It's a bit lighter (and smaller) than the Rowenta but honestly, that's a non-issue.  Also, I really like the teflon soleplate as it keeps the iron from getting hung up on my cotton shirts.  We'll see how it holds up but so far so good!UPDATE: Just want to add a few additional points, one pro and two minimal cons.  I'll start with the good, the extra long cord is really great.  The two minor cons thus far are: 1) As far as I can tell, there's no way to tell when the iron is heating up since the red light is always on, not just when it's heating and, 2) It's very easy to hit the steam adjustment lever (which will turn the steam off if you're right handed) when grabbing the iron.  Minor annoyances but would definitely buy again!"
17,5,"So far so good, I really can't comment on longevity but so far I am liking this iron.  I bought it to replace a leaking Rowenta, and this one does the job for me and doesn't spit water all over my clothes.  It has so many steam holes and is even lighter than the Rowenta.  At first I was worried the lack of weight would impact ironing, but I don't believe this is the case.  My favorite thing about this iron, though, is the long cord.  This has made me LOVE this iron, because my other one was very difficult to maneuver in certain positions because the cord length was 2' shorter.  I don't know if it's clear which model I bought, but I did not get the retractable cord one because I wanted extra length and to save money.  All in all I am liking this iron.  Now I just hope it lasts."
18,5,"After 3 years of use, this iron is still an excellent performer.The coating on the bottom has not worn off with almost daily use during the work week.  It maintains great temperature and steams well.  It does work with softened water - in fact we use softened and RO filtered water in ours and it functions perfectly.  I've read that some irons struggle with softened water and this one has no issues with it.As mentioned in other reviews, the steam setting lever is easy to bump but once you get used to the iron you will not bump it.  It also doesn't leak water when tipping it back and forth.  Other reviewers may have had a defective unit with that issue.We have had a couple of accidental drops off of the ironing board and the unit didn't suffer any damage.I highly recommend this iron - my wife and I use it a lot."
19,5,"I'm a seamstress who uses an iron all day every day. I've lost count at how many other brands I've tried that either perform poorly and/or die after a short period of time. This iron is the best investment ever! Steams amazing, the curved tip is perfect for seams/narrow places, and I love the fact it doesn't shut off every 5 minutes & having to wait to reheat. I'm sure it would work outstanding for clothes too, but who has time for that?! ;)"
20,5,"The steam really comes out . You can even use it as a steamer on clothes you don't want to iron - or curtains/dressesI can't say I enjoy ironing but I have a lot of clothes I have to iron in my family and this has made it so much nicerIt's worth the price , I've had it about 2 monthsAnd as long as it lasts , it's very worth itAnd it does seem very solid and well builtSo I truly think it will be worth itI've bought irons for around $25 - irons that are too light or take forever to get hot , ruin shirts etc.This is the nicest iron I've ever had and I only regret not buying it soonerBuying those cheaper irons was a waste"
21,5,"I have spent about a week trying to find the right way to explain my experience with this iron.Let me begin by explaining my past ironing experiences.  I buy a steam iron and get to work, it spurts a little steam and that's it.  Now I have hot wrinkles in my clothes, that cause me to grind the iron harder into the fabric in frustration.  Perturbed by the lack of steam, I set out pushing that god awful steam shot button until my thumb develops carpel tunnel symptoms.  Ironing, I think to myself, is a pointless chore that is designed to mimic a level of hell.  Enter the Chi Steam Iron.At first use, I crank the steam setting up to the highest it will go.  Within a matter of minutes, the room is full of steam, the windows are moist and I'm beginning to sweat (my pores opened really well, though).  Realizing that this was no ordinary steam iron, I reduce the level of steam and set about my task.  Within moments the wrinkles are gone, as if they saw the advancing army of steam across the horizon and decided to retreat in fear.The iron glides across my clothes, removes the wrinkles with ease, and even freshens the fabric, helping make it smooth and supple.  This iron is no normal iron.  This iron takes the hell-like chore of removing wrinkles from one's clothing and turns it into a mild chore that one can complete in a matter of moments.Gone are the days of pain inducing pressing of the steam button.  Gone are the days of fighting with clothes and ironing.  Happy days are here again, my friends.  All thanks to the Chi Steam Iron, a mythic weapon in the ever revolving war against non-pressed clothes."
22,5,"I was not sure about spending 59.00 for an iron, but after seeing a review on the top 8 irons sold I chose this one (which was the #2 in the reviews) due to the quantity of steam holes, the see through water compartment, the fact that it turns off sitting on it's heal after 30 minutes and beeps when it is turning off. I just wish it had an on/off button so when I'm finished for the day I could just push the button instead of getting under the table to unplug it. I chose the #2 in the reviews because I thought the best one was really ugly & the difference of steam holes wasn't enough to make a difference. It's a little heaver than my last iron, but I like the weight of the iron, it doesn't tip as easy & I don't need as much pressure to get the wrinkles out of my fabric. I would definitely recommend this iron."
23,5,"I had a Rowenta iron for several years and I liked it until it started to leak.  I had been told by my quilting teacher that irons took distilled water and my German made Rowenta evidently didn’t (according to them when I called to complain and the paperwork with it actually did say tap water only).  Anyway, my mother gave me a sunbeam cheap iron and it wasn’t very good but I wasn’t doing heavy sewing with it so I kept it a few years.  I recently decided to make my children each a quilt for their beds and had to get a new iron.  After much research I chose this one.  I am very pleased!  It takes distilled or tap water and suggests using both.  The steam function I wasn’t too sure about at first but I think that was just an initial use thing because it makes ironing all this cotton calico so very easy now!  I have used it on synthetics as well and it did great!  I love the ball and socket joint of the electrical cord.  I also like that it came with a Velcro strap to wrap up the cord.  The disks are all it great places!! I will update if there is anything I don’t like but so far I am very pleased!UPDATE : Iron worked well - until it didn't.  I have used it pretty hard for 3 weeks quilting and it is leaking brown/orange rusty water all over our carpeting.  I am so thankful it started doing it before we get new carpet in a few weeks.  I am not happy.  Returning it and looking for something better."
24,5,It looks just like the picture and all of the descriptions are correct. I previously had the more expensive version of the same iron which was much larger and weighted more than this one which lasted only 3 years but we liked it. the wiring started going flaky but worth fixing at some point until then I decided to get the less expensive though still a chunk of change hoping the only difference would how the iron turned on and the wired didn't auto retract. Unfortunately it is also unimpressively smaller and I don't think it's worth the money.
25,5,"This iron is so good. Makes ironing a breeze and crushes seams that have multiple coming together.  Perfect for quilting.A couple notes:As stated in an earlier review it is very easy to hit the steam gauge with your hand and move it a couple clicks by accident but its not a big deal.A little bit of white residue comes off the iron at first use, it comes off the fabric really easily.I don't have trouble reading the water level.  Its much darker where the water is, so its pretty visible."
26,5,"Bought this to replace a Rowenta (made in Germany) iron which had failed.  I had not heard of the CHI brand, but upon research, seems they have been in the personal care business for a while.  Irons seem to be a newer category that they have entered.I was surprised by how light this was.  I am used to having a ""heavy"" iron, and always equated ""heavy"" as ""good"", but this iron seems to work well.  The steam works well, and does a good job with ironing.  The water doesn't leak from the iron.  The Rowenta would leak if placed flat on the ironing board if it was off.  The water in the reservoir would also slowly evaporate, so that I would have to fill it each time I used it, which was almost every day.  This iron seems to retain the water longer.  The sole plate doesn't stick.I like the fact that the on light can be seen on both sides of the iron.  I am left handed, and have always struggled with irons which only have the light on the side facing a right handed user!  Now I don't have to flip the iron around to see if it is on.  The controls are a bit inconvenient, because they are on the top of the body, between the handle and the body.  That means, to adjust any settings, you have to sit the iron down, take your hand off the handle, and them make the adjustment.  The steam dial is concentric with the heat dial, which makes it difficult to adjust as you are using the iron, and that is why I took stars off from ease of use.  Other irons I have used have some of the controls on the top of the handle."
27,1,"Within using this iron just a few times, the steaming feature began to work erratically. Sometimes it wouldn't steam at all and then later it would continue to steam while ironing and while sitting in the upright position. I've always bought irons with the non-stick surface, however, there was a spot about the size of a quarter that seemed to stick to clothes when ironing. I can only guess that this spot was overheating compared to the rest of the bottom plate, because it eventually burned a shirt and the material was only stuck to that one spot. I have purchased other major brands that have performed well. I will never buy a Chi product again. Perhaps I just got a lemon, but it's not worth taking the risk!"
28,5,"I have had a number of irons across the years, but this model has been my favorite. It's lightweight and the soleplate rarely gets dirty (problem I had with other irons because I use spray starch).Here is my word to the wise: EMPTY the reservoir after each use. Not doing so made me have to scrap my first one and buy new. The instructions say this iron is made for tap water, but you really must empty before you store or you will eventually have very dirty steam on your clean items. UGH.I recommend this lightweight iron!"
29,5,"I am old school. In 30 years I’ve had countless irons, costing up to $$$,  made in Germany etc., and this one is the best ever. I love the heat especially.  I use distilled water and four years later it’s still amazing. I wore the Teflon off the soul plate, but it still works great"
